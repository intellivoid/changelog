# IntellivoidBot v1.0.0.5

Published on Thursday, January 27, 2022 by [Netkas](mailto:netkas@intellivoid.net)

Introduces minor improvements so that the bot will function correctly
during runtime. 

 - Changed the way the main scaled function operates with BackgroundWorker
   by letting BackgroundWorker handle non-blocking events instead of trying
   to re-implement it.
 - Updated DocStrings to help the compiler to catch warnings and errors.
