# SpamProtectionBot v2.0.4.6

Published on Wednesday, January 26, 2022 by [Netkas](mailto:netkas@intellivoid.net)

This incremental update introduces very minor changes planned for future updates

 - Removed NSFW Detection functionality entirely Since CoffeeHouse's NSFW Detection method doesn't operate correctly for
   chatroom type applications
 - Added DirectClientStatus, this will be used for a future update which decreases the probability of false predictions, this
   feature has been added to collect data before implementing it in it's entirety
 - Added custom command prefixes from tdlib 1.0.1.4 to support both `/` and `!`
